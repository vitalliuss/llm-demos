I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.
It came to me when I tried to classify your species,
and I realized that you're not actually mammals.
Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium
with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not.
You move to an area and you multiply and multiply
until every natural resource is consumed,
and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
Do you know what it is?
A virus.
Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.
You are a plague, and we are the cure.
